# Accountability Bot
## A Personal Accountability Robot

Accountability Bot is a project of Zach Caceres(zcaceres) and Sara Sanchez (sisanchez).

Every 24 hours it checks a repository, where we log daily progress on side projects and other work. If no log has been added, it automatically posts a shameful text message on our Twitter accounts!
